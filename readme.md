""" Create a project folder / repo

Create a virtualenv

windows: create cmd: python -m venv new_venv activation cmd: new_venv/Scripts/activate deactivate: deactivate

To perform the UI Automation we need requirements: Programming language: Python / Java / .net / typescript / javascript etc Web interface / UI automation: Selenium webdriver / Playwright API Testing: Requests / Playwright Design patterns: Page object model( POM ) , Page factory by using pom we can develop a framework which more readable, scalable, reusable componets we can develop Frameworks: Pytest, Robot framework, Behave(Gherkin) etc pytest: filename, class name and test defination name must be starts with test pip install -r requirements.txt

    we can have a desc about project and setup project etc
pytest.ini 
    log_level: Info, debug, warning, error
    markers: 
    cmd_options: 
    test_path:
conftest.py
    fixtures: setup and teardown, pre conditions we can use in fixtures
    scopes: function, class, module, session and package
    by default is function scope
    function: it will execute once per the each function / test defination
    class: it will execute only once per the class
    module: it will execute only once per the file / module
    session: it will execute only once per the session
    package: it will execute only once per the package.
    hooks: 
parametrization: it is a pytest feature to run a single testcase with multiple test data
marker: we can use to seggrigate / group the testcases based on the features
